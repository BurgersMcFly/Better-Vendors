## Features

**VendorsAlwaysInStockItemsExpanded**

Vendors are always selling their full inventory.

Known Issues:

Looks like their inventory is affected by your power level and I guess how far into the game you are. I'm def getting way more items on Wilson on my late game saves. Early game saves are still selling way more than the vanilla game, but you might still need to skip time. Def an improvement tho. 

Ripperdocs seem to be missing a single crafting spec sometimes but it's still better than the vanilla game. Might be a progression/power level thing as well. 


**VendorsMultipliedQuantities**

Vendors are selling larger quantities of ammo, grenades, materials, inhalers, food etc.

Known issue: Sometimes buying these items will remove them from the vendors inventory even if there's more to buy.

E.g. Vendor has 500 EMP grenades, you've just bought 250 of them and the vendor just lost the remaining 250. Nothing game breaking, just a minor inconvenience. Not sure why this is happening. Their inventory will regenerate just fine.


**VendorsAlwaysHaveEnoughMoney**

Vendors will never run out of money. Includes every vendor type like Weapon Vendors, Ripperdocs, Drop Points etc.


Can use whatever file you want. Can use any combination of the files you want, even all of them at the same time.
